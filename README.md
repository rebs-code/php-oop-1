# Display Movies with PHP

This project is an exercise in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with PHP. It showcases the use of components and modules to create a structured and organized codebase.

The project is structured into components such as header, main, and footer. These components are used to build the layout of the application.

The modules contain classes such as Movies and Genres. These classes are instantiated in database.php, which contains an array of objects representing individual movies and their associated genres.

This project serves as a practical example of how to use OOP principles in PHP to create a structured and maintainable codebase.
